Rule one: to prevent deadlocks between concurrent transactions, any transaction that updates both the 'users' table and the 'orders' table must always update 'orders' before 'users'. If a transaction updates 'users' before 'orders', reject it. Rule two: to avoid massive memory spikes, any query utilizing window functions like RANK or ROW_NUMBER must include a PARTITION BY clause. If it lacks a partition, reject it. Rule three: our index strategy requires that any SELECT query hitting the 'transactions' table must include a filter on the 'created_at' column in its WHERE clause. If 'transactions' is queried without filtering on 'created_at', reject it. Anything else should be accepted."
