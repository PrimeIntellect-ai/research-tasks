In each step, a node keeps 20 percent of its current score, and distributes the remaining 80 percent evenly among all of its outgoing neighbors. If a node has no outgoing neighbors, it just keeps the 80 percent instead of distributing it. After the distribution phase of the step, every node gets a base addition of 5.0 points. Let's run this for exactly 15 iterations and output the final scores."
