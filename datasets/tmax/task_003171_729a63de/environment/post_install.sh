The humidity sensors in sector A are showing anomalous readings. I suspect water condensation on the circuit boards. I recalibrated the deep learning model for the visual anomaly detection system. It is now achieving 94 percent accuracy on the validation set. I need to order more nutrient solution for the hydroponics bay tomorrow."
