First, any query that references both the 'employees' and 'departments' tables must have a proper join condition on 'department_id'. If it joins them with a comma or an explicit CROSS JOIN without matching 'department_id', it is an evil implicit cross join. Second, any query that selects from the 'logs' table must have a LIMIT clause, and that limit must not exceed 1000. If it lacks a limit or the limit is over 1000, it's evil. Everything else is clean."
