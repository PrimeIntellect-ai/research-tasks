espeak -w /app/audio/lecture.wav "In linear algebra, an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a linear transformation is a non-zero vector that changes at most by a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. The corresponding eigenvalue, often denoted by lambda, is the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled."
